## Advisors

Advisors are the brains of any `tai` application, they subscribe to changes in
market data to record and analyze data or execute automated trading strategies.

Orders are created and managed through a uniform API across exchanges, with
fast execution and reliability.

Take a look at some of the [examples](../apps/examples) to understand what
you can create with advisors.
